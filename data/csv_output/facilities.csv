It was a &#x27;subcritical&#x27; pulverized coal-fired boiler. The station was listed as the least carbon efficient power station in the OECD in a 2005 report by WWF Australia, making it one of the most polluting power stations in the world. At 1.56 tonnes of CO2 for each megawatt hour of electricity, it was 50% more polluting than the average black coal power station in New South Wales or Queensland. Hazelwood emitted 14% of Victoria&#x27;s annual greenhouse gas emissions and 3% of Australia&#x27;s greenhouse gas emissions.<br/>International Power plc purchased Hazelwood Power Station and the adjoining mine from the Victorian Government in 1996 with an expected 40-year life. In 2005, the Bracks Labor Government approved an environmental effects statement (EES) that allowed Hazelwood to relocate a road and a section of the Morwell river to allow access to an additional 43 million tonnes of coal in addition to that allowed under the mining licence boundaries set at the time of privatisation. This was estimated to provide sufficient coal for the plant to operate to at least 2030 (prior to decommissioning plans). The EES also capped its expected total greenhouse output at 445 million tonnes of carbon dioxide over its life, after which Hazelwood may have been made to cease operation.<br/>Hazelwood was jointly owned by Engie (formerly GDF Suez), with a 72% share and Mitsui &amp; Co. with a 28% share.

WPWF,Wattle Point,NEM,SA1,"<p>Wattle Point Wind Farm is a wind farm near Edithburgh on the Yorke Peninsula in South Australia, which has been operating since April 2005. When it was officially opened in June of that year it was Australia&#x27;s largest wind farm at 91 megawatts (122,000 hp). The installation consists of 55 wind turbines covering 17.5 square kilometres (6.8 sq mi)and was built at a cost of 180 million Australian dollars. It is connected to ETSA Utilities electricity transmission system via a 132 kilovolt line.The location was chosen after identification as having one of mainland Australia&#x27;s highest average wind speeds. The wind farm was officially opened by South Australian Premier Mike Rann and Southern Hydro Chairman, Dr Keith Turner. The opening was opposed by some of the local Indigenous Australians, the Adjahdura (or Narungga). A descendant of the traditional landowners argued that construction desecrated an ancient burial ground, disturbing skeletons in the construction of turbine number four. Work was halted in late 2004 after the discovery of human remains, artefacts and tools. The Aboriginal Affairs Department, and the developers, separately commissioned archaeological reports resulting in the development allowed to proceed with five towers being repositioned. Both reports concluded that the bones had come from elsewhere on the peninsula, being later reburied at Wattle Point. The region&#x27;s aboriginal community was divided on construction; Narungga National Aboriginal Corporation supporting development and the Narungga Heritage Committee strongly opposing.Wattle Point Wind Farm was built and owned by Southern Hydro Pty Limited. Southern Hydro was owned by Meridian Energy of New Zealand until October 2005, when it was bought by the Australian Gas Light Company (AGL). The windfarm was acquired by Alinta in October 2006, as part of an asset merger with AGL, and subsequently by the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group&#x27;s Energy Infrastructure Trust, for 225 million dollars on 23 April 2007.<br/><br/>The District Council of Yorke Peninsula approved a second wind farm, Wattle Point Stage 2. However it did not proceed due to insufficient capacity in the electrical transmission lines.The facility is closely connected to the Dalrymple ESCRI battery, a 30-megawatt battery storage facility at Dalrymple substation about 21 kilometres (13 mi) to the north.</p>",NA,-35.11541,137.718672,2023-10-18 04:35:31+00:00,2025-07-08 05:13:16+00:00

The total installed capacity is 192 MW.The green energy generated by the wind farm each year provides electricity for 143,000 households enough to power a city 3-4 times the size of Ballarat.Acciona Energy formed a Community Reference Group (CRG) for the construction phase of the Waubra wind farm, to provide a regular forum for community input to the project and to facilitate communication between members of the Waubra community and the wind farm project team. In 2010 the anti-wind farm lobby group the Waubra Foundation adopted the name of the nearby town.<br/>The construction of the Waubra wind farm received financial assistance as part of the Victorian State Government’s Victorian Renewable Energy Target (VRET).In July 2011 the Australian Broadcasting Corporation 4 Corners program explored health concerns connected with Australian wind farms in its &quot;Against the Wind&quot; report.

YAMBUK,Yambuk,NEM,VIC1,"<p>The Yambuk wind farm is the first stage of Pacific Blue’s four-stage Portland Wind Energy Project (PWEP) in southwest Victoria.</p><p>Located next to our Codrington Wind Farm, near Port Fairy, the site was chosen for its ideal wind conditions – its average annual wind speed of 30km/h is perfect for producing clean, non-polluting electricity.</p><p>Completed in 2005, the 30MW Yambuk wind farm comprises 20 wind generators that produce enough energy to meet the annual needs of 35,000 homes per annum, with an average electricity generation of 92.6GWh per year. The turbines installed are NEG Micon NM72C wind turbine generators, rated at 1.5MW each, with a maximum hub height of 70m and a maximum blade tip height of 106m.</p>",NA,-38.305278,142.018439,2023-10-18 04:35:33+00:00,2025-08-05 05:56:20+00:00
YARANSF,Yarranlea,NEM,QLD1,"<p>Yarranlea Solar is an innovative energy company, which has been established to harness the Earth&#x27;s abundant natural resources to create carbon-free energy. Using a range of technologies, our aim is to deliver renewable energy to established power grids across a 24 hour period. Yarranlea Solar is named after our flagship project located on sparsely vegetated farmland approximately 50km west of Toowoomba. This project will connect to the power grid using the existing Ergon Energy infrastructure in the area.</p>",NA,-27.708939,151.532696,2023-10-18 04:35:33+00:00,2025-07-08 04:57:02+00:00
YWNGAHYD,Yarrawonga,NEM,VIC1,"<p>Yarrawonga Power Station is adjacent to the original weir structure on Lake Mulwala, on the Murray River, on the south side of the Victorian/NSW border. Yarrawonga Power Station was completed in 1994 and is a run-of-river scheme using a Kaplan-type turbine. The station has two ESAC variable pitch Kaplan turbo-alternators, each with a capacity of 4.75 MW, and feeds power into the Victorian transmission grid at a voltage of 22 kV. Despite the power station&#x27;s presence, Lake Mulwala is kept at a reasonably constant level for recreational purposes. Changes in the head are driven by changes in the height of the Murray River. These changes are directly related to precipitation in the catchment areas and water releases from the Hume Dam.<br/><br/>Upstream storage control at Lake Hume and Dartmouth allows consistent storage levels at Lake Mulwala. This permits Yarrawonga Power Station to be a relatively consistent power producer.</p>",NA,-36.009466,145.999568,2023-10-18 04:35:33+00:00,2024-10-29 22:19:53+00:00
